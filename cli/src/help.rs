Some modules require supplementary data to work, in addition to the scanned

multiple times to supply data to different modules. The content of the FILE is
loaded and interpreted by the respective module.

Examples:

In this example, the contents of example0.json and example1.json will be passed

YARA modules analyze files and extract information from them. This command shows all

some information will be shown.

[!...] is the negation of [...]
