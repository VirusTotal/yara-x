Patterns can contains the following wildcards:

?      matches any single character.

*      matches any sequence of characters, except the path separator.

**     matches any sequence of characters, including the path separator.

[...]  matches any character inside the brackets. Can also specify ranges of
       characters (e.g. [0-9], [a-z])

[!...] is the negation of [...]

This option can be used more than once with different patterns. In such cases
files matching any of the patterns will be checked.

The absense of this options is equivalent to using this:

--filter='**/*.yara' --filter='**/*.yar'"#;

produces information will be shown. 

Examples:

yr dump --module pe SOMEFILE
yr dump --module pe --module dotnet SOMEFILE
