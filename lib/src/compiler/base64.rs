/// Given a slice of bytes, returns three strings of which one must be
/// present in the base64-encoded version of any buffer that contains the
/// slice.
///
/// For example, suppose the string "ipsum" can appear somewhere in a file,
/// but it will appear as part of a longer string that has been encoded
/// in base64. Let's say that the file contains the string:
///
/// `TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ=`
///
/// Which is the result of:
///
/// `base64("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet")`
///
/// The result of `base64("ipsum")` is `aXBzdW0==`, which happens to appear
/// within the longer base64 string (the == padding is stripped):
///
/// ```text
/// TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ
///         ------- here is aXBzdW0
/// ```
/// However, due the nature of base64 this is not always the case. The substring
/// "ipsum" can adopt multiple forms in the base64-encoded text, depending on
/// the characters that surround it and its position within the text. For
/// example `base64("-Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet")` produces a different
/// result, which doesn't contain `aXBzdW0`:
///
/// `LUxvcmVtIGlwc3VtIGRvbG9yIHNpdCBhbWV0`
///
/// The good news is that there are only 3 string that we need to look for:
/// `aXBzdW`, `lwc3Vt` or `pcHN1b`. If some string `S` contains "ipsum", the
/// result of `base64(S)` must contain one of these three patterns.
///
/// These three patterns are the results of `base64(S)`, `base64("X" + S)`
/// and `base64("XX" + S)`, after removing the characters that are affected
/// by the "X" at the beginning of the pattern, or that could be affected
/// if more bytes bytes are added after "ipsum".
///
/// padding + S        base64(padding + S)      final pattern
/// "ipsum"         -> "aXBzdW0"            ->  "aXBzdW"
/// "Xipsum"        -> "WGlwc3Vt"           ->  "lwc3Vt"
/// "XXipsum"       -> "WFhpcHN1bQ"         ->  "pcHN1b"
