/*!
This module defines the instructions utilized by Pike's VM, along with various
types that aid in generating and executing sequences of VM instructions.

Instruction encoding format
---------------------------

For most regular expressions the VM code consists in long sequences of
instructions that match specific bytes. For instance, the regexp `/abc.def/` could
be represented by the following code:

```text
  match 'a'
  match 'b'
  match 'c'
  match any byte
  match 'd'
  match 'e'
  match 'f'
```

As observed, the majority of instructions in the code are meant to match
particular bytes, such as match 'a', match 'b', and so on. Instead of employing
a separate match opcode followed by the byte to be matched, which would be the
most common opcode, we can save space by excluding the match opcode entirely.
Instead, we directly include the byte to be matched in the instruction stream.
Consequently, the code predominantly consists of a sequence of bytes to be
matched. However, what about other operations like jumps or splits? How are
such operations encoded within the instruction stream? To address this, a
special marker is utilized to indicate that the subsequent byte should be
interpreted as an opcode, rather than a byte to be matched. This special marker
is defined by the [OPCODE_PREFIX] constant, which happens to be 0xAA due to its
distinctiveness and relative infrequency in real-life patterns (as opposed to
other potential candidates like 0x00 or 0xFF).

Whenever the VM encounters this marker, it recognizes that the byte(s) following
the marker correspond to an opcode that needs to be decoded and executed. While
some opcodes consist of a single byte, others span multiple bytes. Consequently,
the aforementioned example regexp would be encoded as follows:

```text
    0x61  0x62  0x63  0xAA     0x04     0x64   0x65  0x66
     a     b     c   marker  any byte    d       e     f
 ```

This raises the question of how to handle the situation when we need to match the
`0xAA` byte itself. In such cases, we represent it by including `0xAA` twice in the
instruction stream. Therefore, the sequence `0xAA 0xAA` signifies that the byte
`0xAA` must be matched once. Naturally, this implies that we cannot have an opcode
of `0xAA`. Stated differently, the opcode `0xAA` serves as a special case that
solely matches the `0xAA` byte.
