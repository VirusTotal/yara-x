/*! Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) for YARA rules.

A CST (also known as a lossless syntax tree) is a structured representation of
the source code that retains all its details, including punctuation, spacing,
comments, etc. The CST is appropriate for traversing the source code as it
appears in its original form.

Typical uses of CSTs are code formatters, documentation generators, source
code analysis tools, etc. One of the limitations of the CST is that it doesn’t
know about operator’s associativity or precedence rules. Expressions appear in
the CST as they are in the source code, without any attempt from the parser to
group them according to operator precedence rules.

/// A Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) represented as a stream of events.
///
/// Each event in the stream has one of the following types:
///
/// - [`Event::Token`],
/// - [`Event::Begin`]
/// - [`Event::End`]
/// - [`Event::Error`]
///
/// [`Event::Token`] represents terminal symbols in the grammar, such as
/// keywords, punctuation, identifiers, comments and even whitespace. Each
/// [`Event::Token`] is associated with a [`Span`] that indicates its position
/// in the source code.
///
/// [`Event::Begin`] and [`Event::End`] relate to non-terminal symbols, such as
/// expressions and statements. These events appear in pairs, with each `Begin`
/// followed by a corresponding `End` of the same kind. A `Begin`/`End` pair
/// represents a non-terminal node in the syntax tree, with everything in
/// between being a child of this node.
///
/// [`Event::Error`] events are not technically part of the syntax tree. They
/// contain error messages generated during parsing. Although these errors could
/// be in a separate stream, they are integrated into the syntax tree for
/// simplicity. Each error message is placed under the tree node that was being
/// parsed when the error occurred.
///
/// Notice that [`Event::Error`] and `Event::Begin(ERROR)` are not the same,
/// and both of them can appear in the stream. The former is an error message
/// issued by the parser, while the latter indicates the start of a CST
/// subtree that contains portions of the syntax tree that were not correctly
/// parsed. Of course, `Event::Begin(ERROR)` must be accompanied by a matching
/// `Event::End(ERROR)`.
