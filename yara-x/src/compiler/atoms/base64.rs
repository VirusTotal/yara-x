/// Given a slice of bytes, returns three strings of which one must be
/// present in the base64-encoded version of any buffer that contains the
/// slice.
///
/// For example, suppose the string "ipsum" can appear somewhere in a file,
/// but it will appear as part of a longer string that has been encoded
/// in base64. Let's say that the file contains the string:
///
/// TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ=
///
/// Which is the result of:
///
/// base64("Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet")
///
/// The result of base64("ipsum") is aXBzdW0==, which happens to appear within
/// the longer base64 string (after stripping the == padding):
///
/// TG9yZW0g *aXBzdW0* gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ
///
/// However, due the nature of base64 this is not always the case. The substring
/// "ipsum" can adopt multiple forms in the base64-encoded text, depending on
/// the characters that surround it, and its position within the text. The good
/// news is that there are only 3 string that we need to look for: "aXBzdW",
/// "lwc3Vt" or "pcHN1b". If some string S contains "ipsum", the result of
/// base64(S) must contain one of those three patterns.
///
/// See: https://www.leeholmes.com/searching-for-content-in-base-64-strings/
///
/// This function returns the three patterns that can be used for locating the
/// string `s` withing some data encoded as base64.
///
/// Each pattern has an associated offset, that can be either 0, 2 or 3. The
/// offset indicates how many bytes we must go back in order to find a place
/// where it is safe to start decoding the string. This rely on the fact that
/// you can start decoding a base64 string at the middle of it, as long as the
/// offset is a multiple of 4. The string TG9yZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ
/// can be decoded starting at:
///
/// ZW0gaXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ
/// aXBzdW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ
/// dW0gZG9sb3Igc2l0IGFtZXQ
///
/// ..etc
///
/// When this function returns something like (2, "lwc3Vt") it means that
/// "lwc3Vt" can appear as part of a longer base64 string containing the
/// plain-text string "ipsum", and it's safe to decode that base64 string
/// starting 2 bytes before the offset where "lwc3Vt" was found.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// If the provided alphabet is not valid. The alphabet must be exactly 64
/// characters long and can't have repeated characters.
///
/// Also panics if the length of s is 1 or less.
