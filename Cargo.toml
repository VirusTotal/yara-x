# Special profile that builds a release binary with link-time optimization.
# Compiling with this profile takes a while, but the resulting binary is
# smaller and better optimized. For building with this profile use:
#
# cargo build --profile release-lto

# Enable optimizations even for debug releases of yara-x-parser. This is necessary
# because the `logos` lexer produces recursive functions and rely on the rustc's
# tail-recursion elimination. In debug releases these optimizations are disabled
# and the produced code is actually recursive, which produces stack overflows
# with very large inputs.
