The most straightforward way of installing YARA-X in your system is downloading
one of the pre-built binaries that we distribute with
every [release](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-x/releases). You will find
pre-built binaries for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, unzip the binary in
your preferred location, and that's all, you are ready to run YARA-X.

If you prefer to build YARA-X yourself, follow the guide below.

## Installing with cargo

For building YARA-X you will need a recent version of Rust. Follow the
instructions in
the [Rust official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

Once you have Rust installed in your system, type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara-x 
cd yara-x
cargo install --path cli
```
