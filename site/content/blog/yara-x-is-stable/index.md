We’re thrilled to announce the release of YARA-X 1.0.0, marking the end of the beta phase and the beginning of a new
era for YARA users. After months of rigorous development, testing, and community feedback, YARA-X is ready for 
production use. Whether you're hunting threats, automating malware analysis, or building scalable detection 
pipelines, YARA-X provides a modern, high-performance foundation for rule-based pattern matching.

You can install YARA-X 1.0.0 today by following the instructions in the [documentation]({{< ref "installation.md" >}}). 
Start exploring the command-line interface, embedding the library in your tools, or writing your own rules with 
familiar syntax.

This also means that [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) is officially in maintenance mode. No new features will
be added to YARA, only bug fixes.

## ⚠️ What about the original YARA?

With the release of YARA-X 1.0.0, the original [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) project will officially 
enter **maintenance mode**.

This means:

- **No new features** will be added to the original YARA.
- Only **critical bug fixes and security patches** will be applied going forward.
- All future development and innovation will happen in **YARA-X**.

If you're currently using YARA, we strongly encourage you to start exploring YARA-X and consider migrating as it
matures further. That said, there's no need to rush—YARA will remain available and maintained for the foreseeable 
future, ensuring a smooth and gradual transition at your own pace.
