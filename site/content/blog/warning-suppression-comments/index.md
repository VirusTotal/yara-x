By popular acclaim YARA-X 1.4.0 introduces a powerful new feature: fine-grained
suppression of compiler warnings using comments.

While YARA-X has always provided more comprehensive warning diagnostics than
classic YARA, we understand that not every warning is relevant in every
context, especially in edge cases or legacy rules. With this update, you can
now silence specific warnings exactly where they occur, without disabling 
them globally.

This makes your rules cleaner, your output quieter, and your intent clearer.

Learn how to use this feature in the [documentation]({{<ref "disabling_warnings.md" >}}).
