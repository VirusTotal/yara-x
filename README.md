## What's YARA-X?

This is an experimental project for evaluating the feasibility of writing a 
full-fledged implementation of [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) in Rust. 
For the time being don't take this project very seriously, it may be abandoned 
at any time if it doesn't prove to be worth the effort.

However, I would like to get something useful out of this, so the intention is
at the very least implementing a code formatting tool for YARA in the spirit of
`rustfmt` and `gofmt`. In the best case scenario this could evolve into becoming
a serious replacement for YARA.


## Changes with respect to YARA 4.x

This section describes the differences that YARA-X has with respect to YARA 4.x
so far. These differences are not set in stone yet and may change in the future.

### Negative numbers are not accepted in array indexing
  
The expression `@a[-1]` is valid in YARA 4.x, but its value is always
`undefined`. In YARA-X this is an error.

### Duplicate rule modifiers are not accepted

In YARA 4.x rules can have any number of `global` or `private`, for example the
following is valid:

```
global global global rule duplicated_global  {
   ... 
}
```

In YARA-X you can specify each modifier once. They can still appear in any order,
though.


### `<quantifier> of <tuple>` statements accept tuples of boolean expressions

In YARA 4.x the `of` statement accepts a tuple of string or rule identifiers. 
In both cases the identifiers can contain wildcards. For example both of these 
are valid:

```
1 of ($a, $c, $b*, $*)
```

```
1 of (some_rule, another_rule*)
```

The first case remains the same, but the second one has been generalized to
accept arbitrary boolean expressions, like in...

```
1 of (true, false)
```

```
1 of ($a and not $b, $c, false)
```

Notice however that we have lost the possibility of using wildcards with rule
names. So, this is valid...

```
1 of (some_rule)
```

But this is not valid...

```
1 of (some_rule*)
```

### `base64` modifier can't be used with strings shorter than 3 characters

In YARA 4.x you can use the `base64` modifier with strings shorter than 3 
characters, but this is an error in YARA-X. In the other hand, YARA-X won't
produce false positives when the `base64` modifiers is used, as it may happen 
in YARA 4.x in certain cases. This is a well-known YARA 4.x issue described in
the documentation:

> Because of the way that YARA strips the leading and trailing characters after base64 encoding, one of the base64 encodings of "Dhis program cannow" and "This program cannot" are identical.
